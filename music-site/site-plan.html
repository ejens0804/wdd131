			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this website is to provide a couple of music recommendations for music to help people focus.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The primary audience is anyone who needs to focus while working, whether that be employees, students, or the general public.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This website will have Music Recommendations based on mood which the user selects.
                        A recommendation object stores the playlists/songs categorized by mood (focus, relax, energy)
                        and each mood has an array of music objects with a title and file path.</li>
                    <li>
                        This website also has Form Submission Handling through an event listener that is added to the moodForm that:
                        prevents the default form behavior, detects the selected radio button input, calls the displayRecommendations() 
                        function based on the selected mood, and displays a message if no mood is selected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This site also has Dynamic Content Injection (used to display recommendations).  The displayRecommendations(mood) function
						retrieves teh relevant music list from recommendations, dynamically creates an HTML list with playlist titles as clicakble buttons,
						and then it injects the generated HTML into the HTML document.
                    </li> 
					<li>
						This site also features a Dynamic Audio Player Control.  The audioPlayer element is embedded into the website and is injected with the HTML recommendations,
						and it's also customized using Javascript.  After the user on display recommendations, if a mood is selected than it appends the audio player to the page.
						For each recommendation, an event listenr is added to play a corresponding audio file when a button is clicked.  It also sets the audio source dynamically,
						and then plays the audio.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another dynamic element that's part of the site is Dynamic Background Color Change.  This is done through the changeBackgroundColor(mood) function.
						Whenever the user selects a mood, the background color of the page changes to match the mood.  The function takes the mood as a parameter and then sets the
						background color of the body to the corresponding color.
					</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
